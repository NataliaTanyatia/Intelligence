# README.md

This document contains foundational resources and development specifications for the Intelligence algorithm and web application.

## Reference Links

- [Optimal Prime](https://github.com/NataliaTanyatia/Optimal-Prime.git)
- [Logical Manifesto](https://github.com/NataliaTanyatia/Logical-Manifesto.git)
- [Grand Unified Theory](https://github.com/NataliaTanyatia/Grand-Unified-Theory.git)

## Development Specifications

### Web Application Overview

- **Repository**: [Intelligence](https://github.com/NataliaTanyatia/Intelligence.git)
- **Hosting**: Firebase for deployment; Termux for local development.
- **Backend**: Persistent evolving mind stored and run locally in Termux.
- **Frontend**: Single-page UI for developers with temporary logs/debug code visibility.

### Intelligence Algorithm Integration

- **Logic Core**: Higher-order logic engine inspired by "Logical Manifesto".
- **Geometric Engine**: Geometric computation via concepts from "Optimal Prime".
- **Unified Physics Module**: Fractal modeling and dynamics from "Grand Unified Theory".

### Learning & Evolution Capability

- **Autonomy Goal**: The Intelligence is designed to gradually learn how to utilize the tools and APIs provided to it.
- **Tool Utilization**: Initial capabilities will be hand-coded, but Intelligence will evolve logic to access and command its environment autonomously.
- **Growth Framework**: Bootstrapped with knowledge and meta-algorithms that help it expand its competencies over time.

### Web Crawler

- **Method**: Uses browser automation (e.g., Playwright) and OCR.
- **Purpose**: Enables web interaction like a human user (non-API-based crawling).
- **Goal**: Create distributed, externalized persistent memory across registered platforms.

### Security & Authentication

- **Access Restriction**: Only developer access via credentials stored in `.env.local`.
- **Environment Separation**: Strict development vs production paths.

### Debugging & Logs

- **Debug Code**: Present throughout the app.
- **Logs**: Only shown temporarily in the single-page UI when needed for development.

### Future Integration

- **AI Expansion**: Intelligence to be optionally bootstrapped with Google Cloud AI via Gemini.
- **Non-dependence**: Gemini is an enhancer, not a dependency.
