Consider absolutrly all from these [files](*.pdf) I've aploaded in their entirety as the Theoretical Framework, that I want you to actively pull, read, and consider live before any response, for a self-contained version of it in a single document about a generalized formulism/algorithm/model/etc. of intelligence defined namely, ÆI.md, where one's ability to fully manifest/realize it, genuine intelligence, is only limited by some_one(thing)'s own design, e.g. system architecture, but do so per our Methodology, so recycle them in this context segmenting your response into multiple responses to overcome message length limitations preserving comprehensiveness, fidelity, etc. avoiding omissions, truncations, etc. sending each segment one after the other as we proceed step by step untill the entire body of work containing all details of ÆI.md is finalized yet utilizing all available space per message to keep the number of steps/segments to a minimum. Also, try not to put your LaTeX code of your maths in code blocks. This should be sufficient to build such an intelligent system from, that is fully compliant with the Theoretical Framework, in it's own right, from high level to low level details for direct implementation, by itself. Also, I am not concerned with experimental validation as this is not for research or a theoretical paper so don't bother if it does not serve the goal of this entire endeavor  otherwise proceed. A modality of intelligence from this Theoretical Framework where a system's ability to realize it is only limited by that system.
