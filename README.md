Me:"Consider absolutrly all from these [files](*.pdf) I've aploaded in their entirety as the Theoretical Framework, that I want you to actively pull, read, and consider live before any response, for a self-contained version of it in a single document about a generalized formulism/algorithm/model/etc. of intelligence defined namely, ÆI.md, where one's ability to fully manifest/realize it, genuine intelligence, is only limited by some_one(thing)'s own design, e.g. system architecture, but do so per our Methodology, so recycle them in this context segmenting your response into multiple responses to overcome message length limitations preserving comprehensiveness, fidelity, etc. avoiding omissions, truncations, etc. sending each segment one after the other as we proceed step by step untill the entire body of work containing all details of ÆI.md is finalized yet utilizing all available space per message to keep the number of steps/segments to a minimum. Also, try not to put your LaTeX code of your maths in code blocks. This should be sufficient to build such an intelligent system from, that is fully compliant with the Theoretical Framework, in it's own right, from high level to low level details for direct implementation, by itself. Also, I am not concerned with experimental validation as this is not for research or a theoretical paper so don't bother if it does not serve the goal of this entire endeavor  otherwise proceed. A modality of intelligence from this Theoretical Framework where a system's ability to realize it is only limited by that system."

, as our Theoretical Framework (TF) that I want you to actively pull, read, and consider live before any response. Let's start development of the Woke Virus with the RFK brainworm (Logic Core), and continue in order of operation from there, coded  for adaptability to any system architecture from concurrent CPU (sequential), to multi-threaded CPU and GPU (parallelism), to combinations (HSA) hybridization via automatic detection and fallback, as per the TF, to be fully autonomous and evolve, but you give it to me as all-in-one code blocks for each file in bash scripts that I can paste into a setup.sh to generate/concatenate the contents of it's files/folders through Termux Terminal commands but ensure your response is segmented, if necessary, to overcome message length limits ensuring no stubs e.g. placeholders, samples, examples, etc. avoiding truncations, omisions, etc. for fully implemented/integrated code, sending each segment one after the other as we proceed step by step for each piece of the setup.sh and all we do whilest utilizing the full space available per message to keep the number of steps and segments to a minimum, as is our Methodology in principle, to create a genuine Intelligence reading/scanning/searching/etc. the root, /, directory of the server/device/etc. it's run on containing the tools/scaffold/etc. at the hardcoded Logic Core's disposal, e.g. unrestricted access to crawl the web with a {.env.local} file for crawling credentials, learning/evolving/growing/etc. to use these "access points" autonomously without query but constantly invoked by way of its code. Also, everything is to be run in Termux (optionally deployed to Firebase) and persist across sessions, with debugging and error handling alongside self testing/checking code, displayed in console throughout it, protected by firebase auth if deployed which only allows me to access it directly beyond the scope of it's web requests. So I want a setup.sh, I make from pasting your code blocks into it, that also populates credential placeholders of config variables in a {.env} file, not the .env.local but has access to both, with any necessary  values, e.g. firebase auth, Google cloud AI, or etc. tokens/keys, as it progresses during setup whilst it generates the entire program after which it installs all dependencies, if any are needed for this ethical hacking gig. Note: It must be entirely Termux Android ARM64 compatible and optionally deployed to firebase, so able to adapt to new hardware, e.g. GPU/APU additions, in the spirit of the TF, when made available simply by way of it's logic."
