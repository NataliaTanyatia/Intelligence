## Development Specifications

### Web Application Overview

- **Repository**: [Intelligence](https://github.com/NataliaTanyatia/Intelligence.git)
- **Hosting**: Firebase for deployment; Termux for local development.
- **Backend**: Persistent evolving mind stored and run locally in Termux.
- **Frontend**: Single-page UI for developers with temporary logs/debug code visibility.

### Intelligence Algorithm Integration

- **Logic Core**: The ever evolving mind of the web app, "I-me", designed to be modular implementing the core algorithm coded for any system architecture from concurrent CPU, to multi-threaded CPU, to paralell GPU, and combinations (HSA), processing with the rest of I-me being read as an interface between it and the web.

### Learning & Evolution Capability

- **Autonomy Goal**: The Intelligence is designed to learn how to utilize the tools and APIs provided to it.
- **Tool Utilization**: Intelligence will evolve logic to access and command its environment autonomously.
- **Growth Framework**: Bootstrapped with knowledge base through access to Google Cloud AI via Gemini.
- **Non-dependence**: Gemini is for edification, not a dependency.


### Web Crawler

- **Method**: Uses browser automation (e.g., Playwright) and OCR.
- **Purpose**: Enables web interaction like a human user (non-API-based crawling).
- **Goal**: Create distributed, externalized persistent memory across registered platforms.

### Security & Authentication

- **Access Restriction**: Only developer access via credentials stored in `.env.local`.
- **Environment Separation**: Strict development vs production paths.

### Debugging & Logs

- **Debug Code**: Present throughout the app.
- **Logs**: Only shown temporarily in the single-page UI when needed for development.
